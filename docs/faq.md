# FAQ

### How do I get started?

This bot uses your music history for various commands. For this we use a website called Last.fm. 
This site allows you to track your music history [from various platforms](https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic).

To get started you need a Last.fm account. After you've setup your account there you can login to our bot by using `/login` within Discord.

While we require a Last.fm account the bot is not affiliated with Last.fm.

### Commands are showing the wrong songs/ it's not showing what I listen to on Spotify

We get what you're playing directly from your Last.fm profile, so please check there first to see what is showing on [your profile](https://www.last.fm/user/_). 

Last.fm often has issues with their Spotify connection. 
For most people it helps to reconnect Spotify in their [Last.fm application settings](https://www.last.fm/settings/applications). 

Last.fm also has [an official guide](https://support.last.fm/t/spotify-has-stopped-scrobbling-what-can-i-do/3184) on how to fix this.

!!! info ""
    .fmbot is **not** affiliated with Last.fm or Spotify, so we can't fix this for you. Please don't join our support server to complain about this issue.

### The playcounts in the bot don't match Last.fm!

Because we rely heavily on caching your playcounts to keep our commands fast it can sometimes happen that you don't get updated properly.

In this case, try to use `.update full`. This completely re-builds the stored playcounts the bot has for you.

### How do I import my Spotify history into .fmbot?

Check out the [importing page](/importing) for more info.

Using Spotify imports requires an active [supporter subscription](/supporter).

### Who picks what is featured?

The bot randomly picks any user that has used .fmbot in the last day.

### The bot is offline

It could be that it just happens to be updating. If it stays down, please join the [support server](http://server.fmbot.xyz/) and ping one of the developers.

---

### What is the difference between the normal bot and the develop bot?

The develop bot is used to test new fixes and functionality before they go to the normal bot. This is usually announced in #announcements.

This bot can have more downtime and bugs than the normal bot, so that is something to keep in mind. The bots currently share the same database, so switching is easy.

Note that if either bot leaves your server all your server data and settings will be cleared.

### Why does this bot exist?

This bot was made by [BitL](https://twitter.com/BitlDev) back in September 2017 and was inspired by [UB3R Bot](https://ub3r-b0t.com/). Back then the bot just had `.fm`, the charts, featuring and `.fmyoutube`. 

Frikandel joined in when he had the idea of `.friends`, but was too lazy to make his own bot. Together they moved the bot from text files to an actual database and made various other improvements.

Since 2019 Frikandel has been the main maintainer and hoster of .fmbot, adding commands like `.whoknows` and other much-requested features. In March 2021 Frikandel took over all parts of the bot.
