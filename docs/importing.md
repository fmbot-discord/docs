# Importing your music history

The bot uses Last.fm by default for all your music data. We now also offer a way to import your listening history from Spotify and combine that together with your Last.fm stats.

This feature is only available for .fmbot supporters. Dont have supporter yet? <a href="/supporter/">Get it here.</a>

### /import manage

Allows you to manage your imports and pick the source for your playcounts.

You can pick between the following modes:

- Last.fm: Use only Last.fm
- Full Spotify, then Last.fm: Use your full Spotify history and add Last.fm afterwards
- Spotify until full Last.fm: Use your Spotify history up until you started scrobbling


To delete your imports from .fmbot, switch to the Last.fm option and use the provided button.

## Frequently asked

#### Why would I use importing?

Importing helps your music history be as complete as possible. Most people have been using streaming services like Spotify before they signed up for Last.fm, which means they don't have their full history.

Importing helps you combine your full history together with your current Last.fm data for the best .fmbot experience.

You get to keep your original listening timestamps added together with how long you listened to each track for more accurate listening time stats.

#### The import command keeps saying my files are invalid.

We only support files from the 'Extended streaming history' package. You can try uploading the `my_spotify_data.zip` or attach each `.json` file separately.

Discord on iOS currently [does not support attachments](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/issues/5527) other then photos or videos through slash commands. For now you'll have to try on a different platform.

Still having issues? Please open a thread on [our server](https://discord.gg/fmbot).

#### How long does it take before Spotify sends my data?

Spotify sends their files out in waves. For the extended streaming history package they usually do this once every 3 weeks.

#### Does importing in .fmbot add scrobbles to my Last.fm?

No, imported data only shows in the bot. No scrobbles are added to your Last.fm.

#### What happens if I cancel my supporter subscription?

When your supporter subscription expires, you will be moved back to using Last.fm as your only data source.

Your imports are however saved and will be available again if you resubscribe in the future.

#### Are platforms other then Spotify also supported?

At the moment we only support Spotify.

- Apple Music doesn't provide any artist names with their exports. We're exploring ways to still allow for importing, but it will probably not be 100% perfect.
- Stats.fm does not support users to request their own data yet unless you physically come to their office. They're working on making this an easier process.

Want a different platform to be supported? Open a help thread in [our server](discord.gg/fmbot). It helps if you have a data export ready for the developers, so that way they can test a possible integration.

Each platform should have some way for you to request your listening data. This is legally required in Europe, California and various other places around the world.

#### Can I change or delete my imports?

See the [/import manage](#import-manage) command.

#### What data from my imports do you store?

We only store the following information:

- Artist name
- Album name
- Track name
- Time played
- Length listened
